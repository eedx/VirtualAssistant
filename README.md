# VirtualAssistant

This code uses voice_recognition package on python to create a simple Virtual Assistant, capable to search online, look into Wikipedia, YouTube and also tell jokes.

Note that the code was made in spanish, but as it uses the voices downloaded to your PC, there's also english recognition, yet not commands added.
